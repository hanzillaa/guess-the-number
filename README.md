This is one of my first projects I've completed in Python, and I'm pretty okay with it! It's a simple guess the number game with a few things I added on just to see how I could play with the code. The application allows the player ten guesses to guess the number it is thinking of and after that the player has the option to either keep going or exit the game. I may upload a GUI to this repository as well just for fun. I've started one and tried to modify it from this code, but I'm having issues getting it to work just right. Any suggestions or tips are welcome!
